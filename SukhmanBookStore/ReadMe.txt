In the first step I create a new project in Visual Studio 2019 and then
selected ASP.NET Core Web Application, then configured the project by giving 
it the name as SukhmanBookStore.
Next thing we have to do is create a new ASP.NET core web application as in ASP.NET Core 
Web App (Model-View-Controller) and the core should be 5.0 as well as change the authentication 
to Individual User Accountsclick on the Enable Razor runtime compilation and create the project.

the right information such as in the Identity folder there is a file named _ViewStart.cshtml which contains Razor class library
