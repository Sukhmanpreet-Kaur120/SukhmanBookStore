I'm starting the 2nd Assignment. 
In the first step I create a new project in Visual Studio 2019 and then selected ASP.NET Core Web Application, then configured the project by giving it the name as SukhmanBookStore.
Next thing we have to do is create a new ASP.NET core web application as in ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) and the core should be 5.0 as well as change the authentication to Individual User Accounts
click on the Enable Razor runtime compilation and create the project.

In the next step the slieds show to check the following files and the folders that if they are containing the right information such as in the Identity folder there is a file named _ViewStart.cshtml which contains Razor class library
linked to the _Layout in Views/shared folder. Then there are Controllers, Modeles and Views folder which has default controllers, models, homecontroller, erroeviewmodel.cs, _ViewImorts.cshtml and _ViewStart.cshtml.
deletd the migrations folder.
